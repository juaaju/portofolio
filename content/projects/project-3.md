# Digital Anthropometry

Non-contact baby measurement system using image processing and AI for accurate anthropometric measurements in healthcare settings.

## Overview
Developed an innovative tool for measuring infant body dimensions using computer vision, eliminating the need for physical contact and reducing measurement errors in medical applications.

## Technology Implementation

### Image Processing
- **MediaPipe Pose**: Skeleton detection for body landmark identification
- **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**: Meta's advanced segmentation for precise body part isolation
- **Camera Calibration**: Ensures accurate distance and size measurements

### Measurement Capabilities
The system can accurately measure:
- Head circumference
- Arm circumference
- Leg circumference
- Chest circumference
- Abdominal circumference
- Baby Length

### My Contribution
- Pixel to cm metrix circumference
- GUI adjustment with flet
- Excel database

## Software Stack
- **Programming**: Python
- **GUI Framework**: Flet for intuitive desktop interface
- **AI Libraries**: MediaPipe, SAM (Segment Anything Model)
- **OS**: Linux (Jetson Nano)

## Benefits
- Non-contact measurement (hygienic and baby-friendly)
- Fast and accurate results
- Reduces human measurement errors
- Easy to use for medical staff
- Portable edge computing solution
